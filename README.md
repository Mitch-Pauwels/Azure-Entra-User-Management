# 🚀 Azure Entra ID Onboarding Automation Project

This project simulates real-world tasks performed by a Service Desk Engineer in an Azure and Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) environment. It showcases how to:

- Create, manage, and secure user accounts in **Microsoft Entra ID**
- Combine **PowerShell automation** and **GUI-based workflows**
- Respond to realistic **IT service desk tickets**
- Build a production-style lab replicating common helpdesk responsibilities

🎯 **Goal:** Demonstrate the ability to manage identity lifecycle operations — new user onboarding, account updates, and offboarding — using Entra ID and PowerShell.
