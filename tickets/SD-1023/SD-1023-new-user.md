## Full Process - PowerShell Script Automation

Once tested manually, the onboarding can be performed using automation scripts:

```powershell
.\scripts\create-user.ps1
.\scripts\create-group.ps1
.\scripts\add-user-to-group.ps1
```

Each script is modular and reusable for future onboarding scenarios. This reflects how most enterprise environments automate identity lifecycle tasks using Entra ID.
