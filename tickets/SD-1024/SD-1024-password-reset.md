function New-RandomPassword {
    $length = 12
    $chars = @{
        upper   = [char[]]'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        lower   = [char[]]'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
        digit   = [char[]]'0123456789'
        special = [char[]]'!@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}'
    }

    $password = @(
        $chars.upper | Get-Random
        $chars.lower | Get-Random
        $chars.digit | Get-Random
        $chars.special | Get-Random
    )

    $allChars = ($chars.upper + $chars.lower + $chars.digit + $chars.special)
    for ($i = $password.Count; $i -lt $length; $i++) {
        $password += $allChars | Get-Random
    }

    return -join ($password | Sort-Object {Get-Random})
}

$password = New-RandomPassword

### 2. Reset User‚Äôs Password in Entra ID

    Password = $password
    ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn = $true

## Script Automation

Use a modular script for quick resets:
```powershell
.\scripts\reset-user-password.ps1
```

The script will:
- Accept UPN as input
- Generate and apply a new secure password
- Copy password to clipboard for secure delivery

Example:
```powershell
.\scripts\reset-user-password.ps1 -UserPrincipalName "james.wallace@domainjoined.xyz"
```

---

## Resolution
- Review of sign-in logs confirmed smart lockout occurred due to repeated failed sign-ins.

The account for **James Wallace** was successfully unlocked by resetting the password and requiring a change at next sign-in. The temporary password was securely provided to the user via internal channels.
